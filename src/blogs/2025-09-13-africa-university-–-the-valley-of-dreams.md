Is Africa University really the valley of dreams? That’s the theme they proudly go by, and if you asked me a year ago, I might have raised an eyebrow and shrugged. But now, as I reflect on my journey, the answer is a resounding yes – if you know the reason you're here.

When I first arrived at AU, I was focused on academics and adjusting to a new environment. But I didn’t expect how much this place would shape my spirituality. AU is not just about degrees and deadlines. It’s a place where faith and learning intertwine beautifully. Right at the heart of campus is the Chapel, a symbol of something deeper. No one is forced to go there, yet the warmth and peace it offers draw you in naturally.

The Sunday and Wednesday services are refreshing pauses in the midst of a busy student life. But my absolute favorite? The Friday month-end all-night prayers. Those moments have been transformative – filled with music, testimonies, scripture, and a sense of community that goes beyond words. The chaplain, always welcoming, has been more than just a spiritual leader; he’s been a friend, a mentor, and a source of encouragement.

Interestingly, the very things I once disliked about AU have ended up shaping me the most. Take the university-wide courses. I used to complain: "Why should I take African Studies, French, or Ethics and Christian Values? They have nothing to do with my program!" But here’s the thing – university-wide courses build a holistic foundation. They challenge our perspectives, foster empathy, and equip us to engage with diverse communities. Thanks to the French course, I can now hold meaningful conversations with students from the DRC. That language bridge has made AU feel more like a home.

In hindsight, Africa University is the valley of dreams – but not because it hands dreams to you. It’s because it equips you to pursue them with purpose, faith, and resilience. It nurtures not just your mind, but your soul. It challenges you, stretches you, and most importantly, gives you space to grow in your relationship with God.

To current and future students, here are a few words of advice:

Embrace the challenges. They’re often the beginning of your biggest growth.

Don’t just study – connect, pray, serve, reflect.

Make time for the Chapel. Whether it’s to worship, seek peace
